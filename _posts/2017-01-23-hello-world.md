I know, this title is the biggest cliche a programmer can do when writting his first blog post.
But anyway... Hello, World!

This is the first post of my blog! My name is Renato and I'm a Computer
Science (CS) master student at [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](http://www5.usp.br/).

I'm a brazilian, so why am I writing in English? Well, I have 2 reasons:
- I'll write my thesis in English, so this is a great opportunity to practice the language.
- I'm kinda megalomaniac and I believe that the things I write may worth for someone
  (so I want to write in the language that everyone in the tech field can
  read).

As a general note, the purpose of this blog is:
> Write about everything that pop out of my head.

But actually I think the content will be (mostly) about CS stuff. Let's see!

As a reader, you may ask: why are you starting a blog right now?

In the last couple months I've been updating my knowledge about web programming. In this
time I've learned **a lot** through blogs around the internet.

However, once in a while I try todo something that nobody has written about. It saying it
better: I think nobody has written about it in the way that would have helped me to
solve my problem simply and directly. Creating a blog is a way to register my solutions
and share them with people like me.

The turning point that made me make this blog real was an [excellent post](
http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic) about academic
blogging made by Professor Matt Might from University of Utah (USA). If you are a grad 
student and never heard about him, read s blog right now! He has excellent tips for life in academia.

Well, that's all folks! At least for now. I hope you enjoy reading this blog!
If you want to talk with me, just send an email or use the social networks.
