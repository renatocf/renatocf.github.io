I know, this is the most cliche first post title a programmer can evenr do.
But anyway... Hello, World!

This is the first post of my blog! My name is Renato and I'm a Computer
Science (CS) master student at [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](http://www5.usp.br/).

So, I'm a brazilian, so why am I writing in English? Well, for 2 reasons:
- I'll write my thesis in English, so this is a great opportunity to practice.
- I'm kinda megalomaniac and I think the things I write may worth for someone
  (so I want to write in the language that everyone in the tech field can
  understand).

As it says in the description, the purpose of this blog is:
> Write about everything that pop out of my head

But actually I think the content will be (mostly) about CS stuff. Let's see!

But why am I starting a blog right now?

In the last couple months I've been updating my knowledge about web programming
and I've learned **a lot** about it by reading blogs in the internet.

Once in a while I step into something I think nobody has written about something
in the way I'd have liked to read about it. This way, creating a blog became an
idea that grew more and more in my head.

The turning point to make this blog real was an [excellent post](
http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic) about academic
blogging made by Professor Matt Might from University of Utah (USA). If you
are a grad student and never heard about this professor, read it's blog
right now! He has excellent tips for life in academia.

Well, that's all folks! At least for now. I hope you enjoy reading this blog!
If you want to talk with me, just email me or use the social networks.
